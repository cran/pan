.BG
.FN pan.bd
.TL
Imputation of multivariate panel or cluster data
.DN
Implementation of pan() that restricts the covariance matrix
for the random effects to be block-diagonal. This function
is identical to pan() in every way except that psi is now 
characterized by a set of r matrices of dimension q x q.

.AG y
See description for pan().

.AG subj
See description for pan().

.AG pred
See description for pan().

.AG xcol
See description for pan().

.AG zcol
See description for pan().

.AG prior
Same as for pan() except that the hyperparameters for psi
have new dimensions. The hyperparameter c is now a vector of
length r, where c[j] contains the prior degrees of freedom for
the jth block portion of psi (j=1,...,r). The hyperparameter
Dinv is now an array of dimension c(q,q,r), where Dinv[,,j]
contains the prior scale matrix for the jth block portion of
psi (j=1,...,r).

.AG seed
See description for pan().

.OA

.AG iter
See description for pan().

.AG start
See description for pan().

.RT
A list with the same components as that from pan(), with two
minor differences: the dimension of "psi" is now (q x q x r x
"iter"), and the dimension of "last$psi" is now (q x q x r).
